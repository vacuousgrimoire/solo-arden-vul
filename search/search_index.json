Certainly, all of the Twelve were acknowledged by c.500 SP, and thus they were the gods whom the Archonteans brought with them in the great period of imperial expansion.</p> <p>During this golden age, the Twelve each boasted broad portfolios of \u2018expertise\u2019. This made syncretism not only possible but common during the Archontean expansion: it was easy enough for the Archonteans to see in some foreign god a particular \u2018aspect\u2019 of one of the Twelve. Many aspects were thus \u2018discovered\u2019. For instance, [[Sekhmet]] (F) came to be understood as an aspect of Wadjet, with special influence on fire and warfare. Of course, whether or not such foreign \u2018gods\u2019 were distinct entities or merely aspects of the Twelve was, of course, a hotly debated theological point.</p> <p>Some modern theologians blame this flexible and accepting approach for the gradual decline of the Twelve; these critics suggest that by claiming to encompass all things, the Twelve lost their uniqueness and thus their appeal to the broader populace. For whatever reason, worship of the Twelve had become ossified and ritualized by the time of the War of Sortians and Theosophs. By 1855 AEP, the imperial government decided to officially link itself to a new slate of deities, ones whose divine support promised to revive the empire. </p> <p>The new pantheon centered around ten very powerful deities (\u201cthe Ten\u201d) who were served by seventeen (or more) lesser gods. Theological cynics could and did note that many of these \u2018new\u2019 gods resembled the most popular of the \u2018aspects\u2019 of the old pantheon, but the official position is that the Ten are distinct from the Twelve. In the present, worship of the old gods is rare; some of the Twelve are forgotten, at least one (Horus) is presumed \u2018dead\u2019, and another (Set) is the object of secretive, illegal cult worship.
