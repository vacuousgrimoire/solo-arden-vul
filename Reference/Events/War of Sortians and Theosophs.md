By 1679 AEP, [[Priscus Pulcher]] had emerged as the leading voice in the effort to democratize the teaching of magic through the [[Archontean]] empire, and a founding member of the [[Sortian]] party advancing that cause. They are opposed in turn by the [[Theosoph]]s.

In 1687 AEP, [[The Order of Thoth]] votes to democratize their admissions. In response, the [[New Imperial Academy]] is formed by conservative collegiate members.

In 1698 AEP, Emperor Vaslotus IV accuses [[Priscus Pulcher]] of theft from the Imperial Treasury, beginning the war.

In 1713 AEP, [[Priscus Pulcher]] is executed for his crimes.

The war did not finally end, however, until 1793 AEP, and scholars maintain the long years of war are the chief cause of the [[Archontean]] empire's decline and subsequent withdrawal from [[Irthuin]].
