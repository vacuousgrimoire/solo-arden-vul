The Archontean empire claims vast territory, though it originates on the Mithruin continent and is centered on the city of Archontos. The empire is predominantly human, although its citizens include dwarves, halflings, and goblins as well.

The empire once had achieved nearly worldwide dominion, but waned in the aftermath of the War of Sortians and Theosophs. Its fortunes are once again on the rise, and new expeditions to reclaim former imperial exarchates have numerous in the past few centuries.

Tensions with the [[Thorcinga]] have increased.
