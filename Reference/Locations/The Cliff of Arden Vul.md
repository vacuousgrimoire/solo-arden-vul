A 1500' high cliff separating [[Burdock's Valley]] from the plateau on which rests [[Arden Vul]]. The only known route up the cliff that is still passable is [[The Long Stair]]. The cliff is overseen by two enormous statues of ancient Archontean heroes: the warrior Arden and the sorceror Vul, after which the city is named.
