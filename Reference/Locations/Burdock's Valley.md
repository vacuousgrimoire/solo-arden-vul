Burdock Valley is about 90 miles square, carved by the [[Swift River]] out of the foothills of the Emerald Mountains. It is most famous as the site of the ancient city [[Arden Vul]].

Since its resettlement in 2639 AEP, the frontier has been settled with a few towns, most notably [[Newmarket]] and [[Gosterwick]].
