Located atop a [[The Cliff of Arden Vul|plateau]] overlooking the north end of [[Burdock's Valley]], the legendary lost city of Arden Vul comprises both the ruins of an ancient Archontean city on the surface, and the numerous dungeon levels below.

Arden Vul, in its prime, marked the northern frontier of [[Archontean]] civilization on the [[Irthuin]] continent. It was the seat of a powerful [[Archonate]] and home to several Archontean legions. After the great [[War of Sortians and Theosophs]], Arden Vul was abandoned in 1803 AEP, and the city was undisturbed by humans for many centuries.
