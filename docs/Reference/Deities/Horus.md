# Horus

A male greater god and one of the original [[The Twelve|Twelve]] gods of the [[Archontean]] empire. It is generally agreed that Horus was slain, although how is a matter of some scholarly debate.

Horus claimed domain over the sky, the sun, and lawful behavior.

His symbols were the solar disc and the hawk, and his weapon was the mace.
