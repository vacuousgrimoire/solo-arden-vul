# Thoth

A male greater god and one of the original [[The Twelve|Twelve]] gods of the [[Archontean]] empire, being perhaps the oldest, with written references as early as 1218 SP.

Thoth claimed domain over knowledge, judgment, magic, and secrets.

Thoth's symbols were the ibis, the baboon, and arcane runes, and his weapon was the staff.
