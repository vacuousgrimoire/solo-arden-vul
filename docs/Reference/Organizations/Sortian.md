Historically, the Sortians were a group of younger, progressive magic-users led by [[Priscus Pulcher]], who sought to reform the Imperial Collegia, allowing access to magical training to all social classes. This reform effort led to the formation of new collegia and eventually the [[War of Sortians and Theosophs]].
