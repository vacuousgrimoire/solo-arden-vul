# Previous Session
[[006. Morning in the Ruins]]

The party heads north to the pyramid. They circle the base before ascending the worn marble stairs. Once at the apex, they inspect the twenty foot tall statue of ibis-headed [[Thoth]], surrounded by fifteen sculptures of baboons atop short columns.

> "Those great jades in the bird-man's head look rather valuable," muses Thuz.

> "I wouldn't dare if I were you, Thuz. Moreover, let me know before you try, so I can get clear first."

The dwarf looks wistfully at the jades, but he desists.

The pair note the distinctive panel set into the pyramid platform, and the seams on the Thoth statue's arms. With some effort, they manipulate the statue's arms forward, and watch the panel slide to the east, revealing a staircase down.

> "Fine stonework," notes Thuz, "Shall we descend?"

> "Well this is not the way that Margot mentioned, but these stairs are too interesting to pass up."

Byblos lights his lantern and the party descends.
