# Previous Session
[[002. Approach to the Long Stair]]

The party quietly packs and travels to the foot of the great statue of Arden.
> **Thuz:** *This stair is crumbling and slick. Let us use a rope and tread with care.*

The party makes their way past the first switchback without slipping. A sharp yowl ahead startles the party.
> **Byblos:** *Be wary, Thuz: a [[Mountain lion]]!*

The Circle of Skulls draw their weapons and draw themselves up tall, gauging the beast's reaction. The mountain lion seems uncertain, sniffing the air with its ears flat.

>**Byblos:** *"Only one path to tread, or we could draw it off with meat."*

Thuz begins banging his spear on his shield and hollering, hoping to driver the predator off. The cat, flicking its tail, gives a long look up the stairs, then resumes pacing back and forth and yowling.

After nearly an hour-long confrontation, the cat finally leaves, heading back up the Long Stair. Byblos wipes sweat from his brow and the party takes a few swallows from their waterskins before continuing.

At the second switchback, the party discovers the entrance to a tunnel cut into the cliff face. Thuz cautiously enters [[Long Stair guardpost|the tunnel and chamber beyond]] while Byblos keeps watch for the mountain lion's return. After a few minutes, Thuz re-emerges.
> **Thuz:** *There is a small plain chamber beyond, stocked with firewood. A defensible place: let us retreat here if need be.*

The party presses on, hoping to crest the stairs by nightfall.
