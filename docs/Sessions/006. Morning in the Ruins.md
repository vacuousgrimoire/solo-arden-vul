The drowsy adventurers make their way down the cracked, overgrown flagstones leading from [[The Long Stair]] toward a vast pyramid beyond.

>"Margot the Red said the stairs down to the basement were in some ruins west of the Pyramid of Thoth, did she not, Thuz?"

> The dwarf grunts sourly.

They first reach an imposing obelisk and circle round its base, inspecting the inscribed text and images. Byblos leans in close, his mouth forming words soundlessly.

> "Phocius II, Marcion I, Constans II... these are the names of emperors of old. Ptah, Wadjet... hmm, what's this? An ankh, carved very deeply. Perhaps an ankh once went here. And an inscription: 'The Beacon shall be uncovered... or revealed, to those who bring midday life to the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars.' What might The Beacon be? Some secret place of the Thothian priests?"

Thuz appreciates the carved images of humans killing lizards and other varied animals.

The party moves onward, proceeding down a cobbled road lined with ancient oaks before reaching a great plaza in ruins. Pillars, statuary, and outlying builds are uniformly flattened as if by a great hand. The adventurers circle the plaza, inspecting the ruins and the large square tower with the massive bronze doors, where Thuz pauses to listen.

> "Terribly quiet beyond," says the dwarf, "Just the echoes of small sounds."
