# First Expedition of the Circle of Skulls

On a crisp fall morning, the party arrives at the town of [[Gosterwick]], looking slightly the worse for travel. A clean-shaven man of average build in dusty scholar's hat and 

They march, bemused, through the Imperial Gate into an empty meadow, busy with bees and just a handful of outlying buildings constructed.
> **Byblos:** *"Looks like there is still much to build."*
 
Thuz notes the guards drilling in the barracks here, known as the Kettles, as they march past.

They proceed onward and Byblos peers into the quiet and dignified halls of the [[Prosperity Factor]]. After briefly questioning a junior associate there, he departs in disgust.
> **Byblos:** *"Bah! These vultures in [[chiton]] want only gold which we presently lack."*

Thuz notes the guards patrolling in the central market.
> **Thuz:** *"This [[Lady Alexia Basileon|Green Woman]] has guards enough to deter raiders, though I'd prefer stout walls."*
> **Byblos:** *"Lady is the correct honorific, Thuz."*

The market smells of sweat and the smoke of clay kilns. Byblos purchases ink and parchment.

The pair enter the [[Yellow Cloak Inn]], and Byblos inquires of the proprietor, [[Margot the Red]], setting a handful of gold coins on the counter.
> **Byblos:** *"Perhaps you know something a pair of adventurers would find interesting about [[Arden Vul]]?"*
> **Margot the Red:** *"I've heard the ibis priests had a library of rare tomes four levels under the city ruins. Beware, however, it is said to be haunted with ghosts."*
> **Byblos:** *"How does one descend under the city?"*
> **Margot the Red:** *"They say there is a basement in a ruined dormitory west of the [[Pyramid of Thoth]]."*
> **Byblos:** *"How does one reach the Pyramid?"*

Margot the Red scoffs.
> **Margot the Red:** *"You* must *be new. Follow the road north to the [[The Cliff of Arden Vul|cliff]] and climb the [[Long Stair]]."*
> **Byblos:** *"Take the gold. Keep your ears open and there will be more."*

The party follows the road north out of Gosterwick.
