The sweat of the arduous climb quickly grows chill in the night air.
> **Byblos:** *"This [[Cliff Gate|tower]], though ruined, may provide safe shelter. Let us reconnoiter its confines."*

Byblos and Thuz discover little but rubble, splintered wood, and cobwebs until they find a sack of [[Ancient gold solidi|ancient gold solidi]].

The party clears rubble and makes camp.
> **Thuz:** "It smells sour in here, like some animal's musk."

> **Byblos:** *"Your eyes are sharp in the dark. Take first watch."*

During Byblos' watch, as he is stirring the coals of the fire, a pack of six huge spiders return to their den. They catch Byblos entirely by surprise, but seem cautious of the fire and don't immediately attack. He kicks Thuz awake as the spiders creep closer, and the two snatch up their packs and withdraw hastily.

Lucky for them, the spiders do not seem inclined to give chase.
