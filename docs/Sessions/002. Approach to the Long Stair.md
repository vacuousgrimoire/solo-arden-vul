# Previous Session
[[001. First Expedition of the Circle of Skulls]]

The party follows the road north for nine miles until they near the [[The Cliff of Arden Vul|cliff]]. Byblos shades his eyes and peers up at the great statues and [[The Long Stair]].
> **Byblos:** *"That must be well over 1000 ft."*
> **Thuz:** *"A good six hours climb, I'd wager."*
> **Byblos:** *"I don't fancy climbing that and then finding a campsite after dark."*
> **Thuz:** *"Let us scout a bit. Perhaps that [[Ruined watchtower at the foot of the cliff|ruined watchtower]] will make a good shelter."*

The party reconnoiters the ruined ground floor and pronounces it safe enough.
> **Thuz:** *"Let's gather some firewood."*

The party finds a few bundles of firewood in the surrounding area, and makes camp the best they can without tents or bedrolls.
> **Byblos:** *"If only we had snares for rabbits, we'd eat well."*

The party falls asleep quickly to the sound of the roaring [[Swift River|falls]].

Byblos wakens in the night, yelling and trashing, sure some wet thing has wrapped round his face, smothering him. He tries to reassure himself.
> **Byblos:** *"It was just a dream, Byblos, put it from your mind. This expedition* will *succeed, with the help of our wits and our grit."*

Still, sleep is a long time coming.
