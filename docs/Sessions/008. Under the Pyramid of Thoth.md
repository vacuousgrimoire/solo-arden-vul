[[007. The Pyramid of Thoth]]

> "These stairs have seen much use, Byblos. Stand back while I test for snares."

The party descends deeper into the pyramid. They reach a small landing where the direction of the stairs changes.

> "Look at these graffiti. 'Hoss was here'... 'The Darlings were here! Hide your loved ones'... 'I told Robin not to touch the eyes: now his picks are mine,'" reads Byblos.

> Thuz grunts.

The party continues down the stairs to a square room, brightly lit by a strong glow from the ceiling.

> "More graffiti. Are these Wiskin runes? I cannot read them."

> "Look, Byblos, more stairs here. We must well under the pyramid by now."

The pair continue descending, reading a few more graffiti along the way.

> "Plumthorn rules these halls - obey him."

> "Halflings rule - ok?"

After an hour's descent or so, they find themselves in a large chamber with several exits, dimly lit by torches. They have barely time to take in the massive statue of [[Thoth]] on a pedestal and the corpse slumped against the west wall before being startled by shouts from the east and lights moving.

Byblos extinguishes his lantern, the party draws weapons and hides in a corner behind some debris. Six halflings, armed and armored, emerge from the eastern passage.

They fan out, and one calls:
> "Over here!"

As the halflings advance, one snaps:
> "Move into the light, real easy! I'm sure you don't want to give us any trouble."
