# The Long Stair, Part Two
The stairs, at this height, are no longer soaked with the waterfall's spray and become less treacherous, so Thuz stows their safety rope.

At the third switchback, the party comes across a shattered doorway set into the cliff side.
> **Byblos:** *"Whatever violence happened here is long past. Let's look inside."*

Thuz carefully searches the rubble-strewn hall beyond for traps.
> **Thuz:** *"Let's burn out these dusty cobwebs."*

The cobwebs burn well, and before long, eyes stinging and stifling coughs, Byblos speaks.
> **Byblos:** *Perhaps we should adjourn to the stairs? There is... a lot of smoke.*

After the smoke clears, the thick smell of burnt hair hangs heavy in the tunnel. A charred dwarf skeleton beyond clings to a vial of sparkling blue powder, still wearing an intact pair of fancy tooled burgundy and blue boots.

Thuz pulls the boots loose, and smells them warily before putting them on.
> **Thuz:** "These boots are of wondrous craftsmanship and they fit perfectly. Wait, why won't they come off?"

The other end of the passage is empty, so the party continues up the stairs, past two more switchbacks.

As they approach the top of the Long Stair, the glorious coppery sunset fades to purple and midnight blue over Burdock's Valley far below.
